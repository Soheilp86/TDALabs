Often, a dominant rhythm level is deemed the \"tempo\" of the music.  Typical tempos range from about 50 beats per minute to 200 beats per minute.  Let's take a moderate tempo level of 120 beats per minute, for instance, which occurs in the song \"Don't Stop Believin'\" by Journey.  This corresponds to a period of 0.5 seconds.  As we saw in the horse example, sound is sampled at 44100 samples per second.  This corresponds to an ideal sliding window interval length of 22050.  Let's try to compute the sliding window embedding of the raw audio to see if the tempo manifests itself with TDA.  First, we will load in \"Don't Stop Believing\" below:"
